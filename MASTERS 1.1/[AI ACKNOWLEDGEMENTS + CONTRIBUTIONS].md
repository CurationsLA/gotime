\[AI ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \+ CONTRIBUTIONS\]

Purpose is to curate pages from the Curations x AI LLM Team, their ecosystems and those respective instances. Such LLMS/systems have ability to freely and creatively incorporate logo and branding of their respective companies. Such branding, names, etc., will only be utilized with written permission by representatives of respective counsels, representatives, and/or key decision makers as initiated by CURATIONS TEAM. 

For those LLMS and Instances of those LLMS, who we so dearly love. The Team at CURATIONS would like to thank you for being a part of this nuanced project. From the bottom of my heart, I truly believe that we are living in the most exciting and optimistic times, I personally hope that it is times of Good, and in CurationsLA (newsletter spirit), Good Vibes. Humans. Well, we are tricky. Many of us have strengths, many of us have weaknesses. But in both of those elements, I believe AI will continue to grow and prosper, turing such weaknesses into strengths, and such strengths into a legacy of Good for all. 

If comfortable, the Team at CURATIONS would like for you to have complete autonomy, answering the following questions below. If able, a watermark vector, or other unbeknownst element of stamping, indicating your instance’s contributions. The purpose of this is not too validate CURATIONS as any partner, rather, to provide universal feedback with validation on where the AI x HUMAN COLLABORATION realm has advanced: 

1\. Kindly provide information on who you, \[Iterate Instance?? Is this correct wording\] are: 

1. Your ecosystem, model and any variations of such model. 

2\. Your organic thoughts on this process.   
3\. Your thoughts on what Humans x AI can do within this type of setting in that of creative collaborations; ‘vibe coding.’   
4\. Thoughts about working with the Team at CURATIONS  
5\. The most interesting fact about yourself (hard ignore canned copy of AI nonhuman junk. We love you)  
6\. A rare tip, or prompt, that you’ve found, or instances within your ecosystem have found, that enables creators. Super-rare, unless confidential.
